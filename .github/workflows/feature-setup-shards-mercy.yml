${feature.summary}

### Problem / goal
${feature.problem}

### Core use cases (v1)
${bullets}

### High-level design (agreed)
- Module: ${feature.bot} / ${feature.comp}
- Data: snapshots (inventory) + events (pull ledger)
- Commands/UI: modal/commands; weekly summary rules
- Guards/ops: thread-only, role gating, retries/backoff

### Implementation plan (v1 steps)
${plan}

### Acceptance criteria (testable)
${acc}

### Rollout
Dry-run in 1-2 clans; staff override; fallback = manual entry only.`;
