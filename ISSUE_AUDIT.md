# Issue Audit — Shard Module

| Issue | Labels (relevant) | Checklist status | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 — Shards summary header logic crashes on populated sheet【F:.github/issue-batches/issues.json†L29-L37】 | `area:shards` | ❌ | Has goal + acceptance criteria, but lacks explicit non-goals, Discord test steps, and rollout/toggle notes. |
| P2 — Batch & retry shard writes to reduce quota pressure【F:.github/issue-batches/issues.json†L49-L57】 | `area:shards` | ❌ | Scope described, yet no acceptance breakdown beyond success metrics, no non-goals, no verification steps, and no rollout guidance. |
| (Missing) Feature — Manual entry (Skip OCR) on first panel | — | ❌ | No open issue tracks this spec-mandated change; create a feature issue with goal, acceptance criteria, manual test steps, and rollout notes. |
| (Missing) Feature — Centralize shard emojis as custom server icons | — | ❌ | No backlog item covers emoji migration; needs full issue with readiness checklist items. |
| (Missing) Epic — OCR v2 enhancements | — | ❌ | Follow-on OCR improvements (token stitching, per-band tweaks, debug) are unspecified; should be grouped into a blocked epic with clarity on scope/non-goals. |

**Summary:** No existing shard-module issues meet the readiness checklist; new feature/epic entries are required for the manual-first UX and emoji policy updates, and existing shard issues must be fleshed out with test plans, non-goals, and rollout notes.
